1. **[Rocheston Reinvent Conference July 2021](https://reinvent.rocheston.com/schedule.html) :sparkles: [Threat Intelligence for the Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be16-_xbjdw) (Date: July 24th, 2021)**: This session talk is about understanding threat intelligence fundamentals. Threat Intelligence is a significant measure for not only on-prem security but also for Cloud Security Posture Management. While discussing about the major threats and scenarios in cloud environment, its been explained about the newer threat additions with the help of Cloud Security Alliance research.

2. **[AWS Community Day South Asia Virtual Edition 2021](https://communityday.awsug.asia/) :sparkles: [S3 Security: Attack and Defense](https://youtu.be/Q4Wkfo5BXyo?t=8974) (Date: Oct. 22nd, 2021)**: This session talk is about AWS S3 Security Best Practices, emphasizing on Attack and Defense ways. This will cover a few scenarios how attackers exploit AWS S3 resources that led to either data breach or ransomware attack. It will also encounter fundamentals of threat modeling for AWS S3 resources. Its around overall understanding with S3 Security for implementation and strategic as well as technical security controls to be put in place. Presentation [here](https://github.com/ntnshrm87/ConnferenceTalks-NitinS/blob/main/ACD2021%20-%20S3%20Security_%20Attack%20and%20Defense.pdf). 

3. **[NullCon Webinar 2022](https://nullcon.net/archive-download/webinars):sparkles: [Securing IaC - The Attack and Defense] (Date: Mar. 4th, 2022)**: The advent of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, as well as the ever-increasing demands on IT infrastructures, has increased the need for consistent and scalable automation. Infrastructure as code (IaC) is useful in this situation. When IaC practice is integrated into CI/CD pipeline and versioning is enabled, it helps the organization to enhance the security posture and maintain security and compliance over time while making constant changes as per the business requirements. Therefore security risks, non-compliance, policy violations, and misconfigurations can be prevented before runtime and in production environments. It also helps to decrease security posture drifts. 
This session will cover Terraform/Cloudformation IaC aspects from an attack/defense perspective to manage security risks within the cloud environments. Presentation [here] ()
