3. **[NullCon Webinar 2022](https://nullcon.net/archive-download/webinars):sparkles: [Securing IaC - The Attack and Defense] (Date: Mar. 4th, 2022)**: The advent of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, as well as the ever-increasing demands on IT infrastructures, has increased the need for consistent and scalable automation. Infrastructure as code (IaC) is useful in this situation. When IaC practice is integrated into CI/CD pipeline and versioning is enabled, it helps the organization to enhance the security posture and maintain security and compliance over time while making constant changes as per the business requirements. Therefore security risks, non-compliance, policy violations, and misconfigurations can be prevented before runtime and in production environments. It also helps to decrease security posture drifts. 
This session will cover Terraform/Cloudformation IaC aspects from an attack/defense perspective to manage security risks within the cloud environments. Presentation [here](https://github.com/ntnshrm87/ConnferenceTalks-NitinS/blob/main/Securing%20IaC_%20The%20Attack%20and%20Defense.pdf).

Within AWS, this can be done with the help of AWS IAM service. A minute misconfiguration can be very dangerous as seen with different cloud attacks globally. This sesssion talks about a few red team attack patterns in a fun way referred to as "Gambits" from the game of chess.
